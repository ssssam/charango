Charango 0.3.0 - design
------------------------

Charango is essentially an RDF-based data model & view.

Terminology I currently use
---------------------------

How to do describe what is basically an object or entry?
So a 'resource' - is an rdf:
rdf:Instance: instance of a Class ..

so we either want to call it Instance, or Resource ..

an Instance of an rdfs:Class.


Ontology sources
----------------

The Charango.Context needs a full class heirarchy. This needs to come from
somewhere: either on disk or the web. Theoretically we could query them from
Tracker too, but they may as well be supplied on disk if they're going to be
supplied.

How easy is it to add new ontologies to Tracker?

Tracker run-time extension of ontologies is PLANNED:
  http://www.mail-archive.com/tracker-list@gnome.org/msg05852.html
but currently only possible at install-time. I guess when Charango connects to
Tracker it needs to check if all ontologies are available then, and in future
it would be able to add them at runtime. Of course getting Music Ontology
included would be cool but not sure if they will do this :) If not, Calliope
will be able to install it itself at least.

Charango lazily loads classes from the ontologies, because there are often lots
that aren't relevant.
