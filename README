--------------

This project was an attempt at representing RDF data nicely using the
GLib/GObject type system.

Its spiritual successor is the
[TrackerResource class](https://developer.gnome.org/libtracker-sparql/stable/TrackerResource.html)
from [libtracker-sparql](https://developer.gnome.org/libtracker-sparql/stable/),
part of the [Tracker](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Tracker) desktop indexer.
